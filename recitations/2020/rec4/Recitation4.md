313-Recitation 4: Requirement Interviews

**Goal:** In this recitation, students will practice interviewing
stakeholders and resolving conflicts.

**Part 1: Conflicting Requirements (15 min.)**

Pair up. Consider the following conflicting requirements. For each
scenario, identify if there is a conflict and, if so, how can the
conflict be resolved?

1\. Security: Fraudsters should never be able to withdraw funds.

Manager: Customers should not be inconvenienced.

2\. Manager: The authorities should be notified of any suspicious
activity.

Emergency services: Don't bother us with spurious calls.

3\. Lawyer: We are required to maintain chain of custody for evidence to
be admissible in trial.

Manager: We'll need to use a cheap cloud storage provider to keep costs
down.

**Part 2:** **Bad Interviews (15 min.)**

For this part, we are going to work on a new ATM security feature for
PNC Bank. The customer wants to use the existing security cameras in the
ATMs to automatically detect suspicious activity and take appropriate
action. For example, the ATM should limit withdraw amounts if a customer
is not recognized or call the security guard and/or authorities if
someone is attempting to steal from the machine
