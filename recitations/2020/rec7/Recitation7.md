313-Recitation 7: CI++

**Goal:** During this recitation, students will explore different types
of analysis that can be integrated into their development process as
part of the continuous integration.

**Task: **

1.  Ensure you have a fork of Mayan-EDMS from GitHub.

    a.  This fork should be public for this exercise

2.  Sign up for Code Climate:

    b.  Visit https://codeclimate.com

    c.  Click Login

    d.  Click Quality

    e.  Follow instructions and add the repository for Mayan-EDMS to
        Code Climate.

3.  Run a basic Maintainability analysis on the project.

    f.  What was the maintainability grade?

    g.  How was that grade computed?

    h.  How many \"Code Smells\" did it uncover?

    i.  Browse through the issues it discovers.\
        Were they all valid or were there some that were not actually
        issues?

4.  Tune the repository settings in Code Climate.\
    Stop warning on issues you do not think are actual issues you should
    be worried about.

    Which options did you disable?

5.  Find one code smell that you think is an actual issue.\
    What was it?

6.  Create a ticket for this code smell using the Code Climate interface
    using GitHub Issues. You\'ll have to get a GitHub authorization
    token and configure it for the project.
