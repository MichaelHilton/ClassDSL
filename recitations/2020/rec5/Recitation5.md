313-Recitation 5: Software Requirements

**Pair up.**

**Goal:** During this recitation, student will**:**

> 1\. Identify key stakeholders
>
> 2\. Identify and prioritize quality (non-functional) and functional
> requirements

**Context:** For this recitation, we are going to work on a new ATM
security feature for PNC Bank. The customer wants to use the existing
security cameras in the ATMs to automatically detect suspicious activity
and take appropriate action. For example, the ATM should limit withdraw
amounts if a customer is not recognized or call the security guard
and/or authorities if someone is attempting to steal from the machine.
The important questions to ask in this task are:

1\. Who are the stakeholders of the project? Who would be impacted by the
new feature?

2\. What are the important quality (non-functional) and functional
requirements?

**Part 1: Initial high-level requirements (15 min.)**

**Who are the key stakeholders of the new feature?**

**At a high level, what are the primary functional requirements for the
new feature? What are the important quality (non-functional)
requirements? What is their priority?**

**Part 2: Non-functional requirements (10 min.)**

**Choose one non-functional requirement. What are the concrete steps
that your group will take to make sure that you have satisfied
requirement? **

Your group will describe these steps in class. Think about presenting
this information to the client. You need to describe a type of contract
on what the requirement is, how the client will measure the requirement,
and when the requirement is satisfied. Then, the class will decide if
they would accept your contract or not.
