During this recitation, I had them convert the Docker commands used to start
the database and mayan-edms systems into a single Docker compose file.

- Mistakenly, I didn't realize that the project itself had a docker-compose
in one of it's subdirectories which some of the students had already been
using (1 in recitation 1, 3 in recitation 2.)

- Students in recitation 2 asked what the point was in writing one when one
was already there. I told them that there was benefit in *learning* how to
write one themselves rather than just using what's there, as it always won't
be there. As expected, even the students who had been using it had trouble
writing the new one -- minor things, formatting, yaml things, knowing what
goes where. Most students finished right before the end of the recitation, so
I think it was successful overall.

- *Lots* of Docker issues: old versions, incorrectly installed versions,
problems with file shares, etc.
